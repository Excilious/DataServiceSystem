# DataServiceSystem
RBX DataServiceSystem in which would contain ways the system may store, receive and output data. This would need services such as API services to work

This pack would contain most things in which would help save and fetch data without the use of a temporary state such as a value. Some of the code cannot be access within the client side
and would need a few RemoteEvents to access the data. You would also need to place these within the following places below.

DataService (v1.0) = ServerScriptService (Script Format)

*This is free to use* and you dont need to credit the author. Please attempt to follow the instructions since you would have a better understanding towards my code
and make my code way better.

Some of the code is not tested and may contain bugs that could break the system. Changes will be made but if there is any errors, please dont hesitate to enter them 
within the issues panel above. I will *try* to fix any bugs that appear. 

Please note that i am *not* a professional coder. I just do this as a hobby. There might be better ways to code this but thats the best i can do. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
